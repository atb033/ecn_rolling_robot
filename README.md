# ecn_rolling_robot


These codes were created for the dynamic modelling of a reciprocating mass type 3D rolling robot. 

Dynamic models of three robots: (i) without any compliant element, (ii) with fixed stiffness springs, and (iii) with variable stiffness springs were created in MATLAB. 

The model was validated in ADAMS.

Trajectory tracking control of the robot was also performed.
