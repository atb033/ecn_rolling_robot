! parts without mass properties. Check the following parts to ensure
! that they are valid without mass properties specified:
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.core has no center-of-mass marker
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.core has no mass
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke4 has no center-of-mass marker
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke4 has no mass
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke3 has no center-of-mass marker
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke3 has no mass
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke2 has no center-of-mass marker
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke2 has no mass
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke1 has no center-of-mass marker
! Part .MODEL_3D_RR.spoke1 has no mass
